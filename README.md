AI-POWERED SPORTS SOLUTION

🏟️ Scout Sync – An AI-powered sports Scouting and Predictions Platform
Live App: Try Scout Sync 

📌 Project Overview
Scout Sync is an AI-powered scouting and prediction platform built for two primary use cases:

🧠 Solution 1: Player Scouting & Performance Analysis
👤 Target Users: Coaches, Academies, Scouts
🎯 Purpose: Evaluate individual athletes using AI-driven insights.

✅ Features:
Upload Player Videos (feature coming soon): Analyze speed, agility, ball control.

Player Profiles & Ratings: View stats, skill breakdowns, and AI-generated scores.

Scouting Reports: Auto-generated reports for recruitment or coaching review.

📌 Real-World Use Case Example:
A football coach at a youth academy uploads match footage of a player.
Once video analysis is enabled, the AI processes this footage to generate:

Player’s average sprint speed

Ball control rating (out of 10)

Agility movement heatmap

Then, the coach views the player’s full profile in the “Players” tab, checks recruitment recommendations, and downloads a PDF report for sharing with talent scouts.

📊 Solution 2: Football & Formula 1 Team Insights and Predictions
👥 Target Users: Sports Analysts, Fans, Strategists
🎯 Purpose: Access team & driver stats, visualize performance, and view AI predictions.

✅ Features:
Football Dashboard: See team stats (possession, win ratio), compare players, and view performance trends.

Formula 1 Section: Explore driver cornering ability, lap times, pit stop speed, etc.

Future Predictions (Coming Soon): Get AI-generated predictions for match results or race outcomes.

📌 Real-World Use Case Example:
A Formula 1 fan opens the dashboard to compare Hamilton vs. Verstappen over the last 5 races.
The app shows:

Average lap time comparison

Pit stop efficiency

Cornering rating (based on previous race data)

Meanwhile, a football data analyst uses the platform to study two teams’ ball possession trends, compares key players, and evaluates win probabilities before an upcoming match.
